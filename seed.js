Blossoms require pollination to set fruit, so be kind to the bees! When rinds begin to change from green to tan or yellow, the melon is probably ripe, but be careful not to pick too early. Look for a crack in the stem where it attaches to the fruit. This is a sign of ripeness as well. The fruit should be easy to separate from the vine, but if they fall off by themselves they are usually overripe. Harvest melon when vines are dry, and be careful not to damage them.",

They prefer very rich soil that is well-drained and not too soggy. Mix lots of compost and aged mature into the planting site before you sow seeds or transplant. Pumpkins do best when the seeds are directly planted in the ground. Use row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. However, remember to remove covers before flowering to allow pollination by insects! Add mulch around your pumpkins to keep in moisture, suppress weeks, and discourage pests. Remember that pumpkins are tender from planting to harvest. Control weeds with mulch. Do not over-cultivate, or their very shallow roots may be damaged. Pinch off the fuzzy ends of each vine after a few pumpkins have formed. This will stop vine growth so that the plant’s energies are focused on the fruit. Your best bet is to harvest pumpkins when they are mature. They will keep best this way. Do not pick pumpkins off the vine because they have reached your desired size. If you want small pumpkins, buy a small variety. A pumpkin is ripening when its skin turns a deep, solid color (orange for most varieties). When you thumb the pumpkin, the rind will feel hard and it will sound hollow. Press your nail into the pumpkin’s skin; if it resists puncture, it is ripe. To harvest the pumpkin, cut the fruit off the vine carefully with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear. Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin; a liberal amount of stem (3 to 4 inches) will increase the pumpkin’s keeping time.",

It is more difficult to than its relatives because it does not tolerate the heat or cold as well. For this reason, cauliflower is usually grown commercially. If you plan to attempt growing cauliflower in the home garden, it requires consistently cool temperatures with temperatures in the 60s. Otherwise, it prematurely “button”—form small button-size heads—rather than forming one, nice white head. Note that the cauliflower will start out as a loose head and it takes time for the head to form. Many varieties take at least 75 to 85 days from transplant. Be patient. When the curd (the white head) is about 2 to 3 inches in diameter, tie the outer leaves together over the head with a rubber band, tape, or twine. This is called blanching, and it protects the head from the sun and helps you get that pretty white color. The plants are usually ready for harvest 7 to 12 days after blanching. When the heads are compact, white, and firm, then it is time to harvest them. Ideally, the heads will grow 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Cut the heads off the plant with a large knife. Be sure to leave some of the leaves around the head to keep it protected. If the heads are too small but have started to open up, they will not improve and should be harvested.

Make sure that the covering is 2 to 3 feet tall so that the plants have room to grow. If you do not start your okra plants early, wait until there is stable warm weather. You can plant okra in the garden when the soil has warmed to 65° to 70°F. Eliminate weeds when the plants are young, then mulch heavily to prevent more weeds from growing. Apply a layer of mulch 4 to 8 inches high. After the first harvest, remove the lower leaves to help speed up production. Harvest the okra when its about 2 to 3 inches long. Harvest it every other day. Cut the stem just above the cap with a knife; if the stem is too hard to cut, the pod is probably too old and should be tossed. Wear gloves and long sleeves when cutting the okra because most varieties are covered with tiny spines that will irritate your skin, unless you have a spineless variety. Do not worry: this irritation will not happen when you eat them.',

Hoe the beds occasionally to keep weeds down. Remember to reshape the beds with soil or mulch. For good harvests, do not prune the vines, because they should be vigorous. You can start digging up the potatoes as soon as they are big enough for a meal. The leaves should have started to yellow, but you can leave them in the ground up until the fall frost.
